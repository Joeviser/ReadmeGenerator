# README GENERATOR

## Description

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The task in this project is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command: Node index.js

## Usage

- Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

- Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
