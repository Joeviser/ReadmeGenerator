  ## Installation 
  As developer I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

  ## Usage 
  Given a command-line application that accepts user input when I am prompted for information about my application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

  ## Licence
  Application covered by MIT license

  ## Credits 
  NONE
  
  ## Tests 
  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
